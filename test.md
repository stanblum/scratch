SPNHC-TDWG 2024 REMINDERS AND UPDATES

Planning for the SPNHC-TDWG Joint meeting in Okinawa, Japan (Sept 2-6) is moving along quickly. To help us make this a great conference, please be aware of the following items.

**ABSTRACTS ARE DUE in Oxford Abstracts on or before Friday, April 19th.** We have a tight turnaround for reviewing abstracts and notifying authors, so **we will not be extending the deadline.** See the official [Call for Abstracts](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/call-for-abstracts/) for [Submission Guidelines](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/oa-abstract-submission-guidelines/) for relevant information. The call for extended abstracts in BISS (see [examples from past years](https://biss.pensoft.net/collections)) will be released later in May.

DO YOU NEED CHILD CARE IN OKINAWA? If so, please let us know, via email, [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org) **on or before April 19th** so we can determine the best course of action and provide the necessary information to you and your little ones.

Registration for the conference is scheduled to open around May 1st (give or take a few days). Our current budget projects suggest that the cost will be between $500-600 USD, for early bird members of SPNHC or TDWG. So, if you are not a member of one or both organizations, please consider joining; [SPNHC Membership](https://spnhc.org/get-involved/become-a-member/join-now/), [TDWG Membership](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/).

If you have any questions about the SPNHC-TDWG Joint Meeting, please contact us,
